# Resources for Compassionate Technologists
This repository is a collection of resources designed to provide concrete, practical, and actionable examples of coding with empathy. When empathy is taught in a general context, it can come across as mere intuition or psychic ability. The resources here are specific and relevant to the context of creating software. 

People who actively work on a software product will likely get the most out of this repository. This is more than people who write code. Leaders, managers, product owners, UX and Customer Experience folks, testers, Agilists, and people who interact directly with customers are likely to find useful information here, too. 

The maintainer of this project is [Andrea Goulet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamgoulet), who originally created it to accompany her book, _[Empathy-Driven Software Development](https://heartware.dev/book)_. 

You can also join the accompanying [Empathy in Tech](https://empathyintech.com) community to access our Discord server, free events, and more. 

## Format
This repository will start using the [awesome-list](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list) format. The README file is where the action is. As resources are added, we'll organize them into relevant categories. We're particularly inspired by [the-book-of-secret-knowledge](https://github.com/trimstray/the-book-of-secret-knowledge) by [Michał Ży](https://github.com/trimstray).

GitHub [automatically generates a Table of Contents](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-13-table-of-contents-support-in-markdown-files/), which may make it easier for you to navigate the content.

For a sleeker reading experience, you can [view the content on GitHub pages](https://andreagoulet.github.io/empathy-driven-development). 

## Contributing
Contributions welcome! In addition to the list, we're also hoping to use GitHub's discussions feature to help build a robust knowledge base that allows for nuance and conversation. Our hope is that utilizing this feature first will help make it easier for people who work in software but don't use GitHub regularly to contribute their ideas. 

### Adding Content & Asking Questions
Here's the general workflow for getting an idea out of your head so we can consider adding it to the list. 

1. **Start with a discussion** to [share your ideas]([https://github.com/andreagoulet/empathy-driven-development/discussions/categories/ideas](https://github.com/andreagoulet/empathy-driven-development/discussions/categories/suggest-a-resource)), [ask questions](https://github.com/andreagoulet/empathy-driven-development/discussions/categories/q-a), and [connect with other community members](https://github.com/andreagoulet/empathy-driven-development/discussions/categories/general). 
2. **Maintainers will create issues** from relevant discussions. 
3. **Address issues with pull requests** for a maintainer to review.

### Small Changes
If you find a relatively simple issue, such as a typo or a broken link, you can submit a pull request directly.
