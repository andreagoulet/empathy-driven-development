# Empathy-Driven Development
Resources to help software developers integrate empathy into their daily workflow. 

## Description
Hi! I'm Andrea Goulet. For the past decade, I've been diving deep into the technical aspects of empathy and how to operationalize it when building software. What I consistently hear is that people are craving concrete examples and exercises. This repository aims to be a public source for software developers to use for inspiration and learning.

## Getting Started
The project is set up through GitHub pages. Since the content is mostly static, there is nothing to install. This may change if we start adding interactive resources.
